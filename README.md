26W Intro to Object-Oriented Programming - Java

Course Duration: January 7, 2026 – April 30, 2026

📌 Overview
This repository contains all the assignments, projects, and practice exercises completed for the 26W Intro to Object-Oriented Programming in Java course. 
The course focuses on foundational concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**Extends X Implements**
Extends - Inheritance
-Used when a class inherits from another class (single inheritance).
-Used when an interface inherits from another interface (interfaces can extend multiple interfaces).
-The subclass inherits fields and methods from the superclass and can override them.

Implements - Interface
-Used when a class implements an interface.
-The class must provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods in the interface.
-Supports multiple inheritance of type, since a class can implement multiple interfaces.
